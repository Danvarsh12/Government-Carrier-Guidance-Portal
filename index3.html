    <p>The Government General Hospital was established on 16 November 1647 to treat soldiers of the British East India Company.[1] Madras Medical College was established on 2 February 1835.[2][3] Mary Scharlieb graduated from Madras Medical College in 1878.[1]

        In 1996, when the metropolis of Madras was renamed as Chennai, the name of the college also changed to Chennai Medical College. It was later re-renamed back to the Madras Medical College since the college was known worldwide by the older name.
        
        The foundation stone for the new building of the college was laid by the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi, on 28 February 2010.[4]
        
        In January 2011, the hospital was renamed as Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.[5]</p>

    <p>Stanley Medical College and Hospitals is one of the oldest centers in India in the field of medical education.[3] The seed for this institution was sown as early as 1740 when the East India Company first created the medical department. The Stanley Hospital now stands on the old site of the Monegar Choultry established in 1782.[4] In 1799, the Madras Native Infirmary was established with Monegar Choultry and leper asylum providing medical services.[4]

        In 1830, philanthropist Raja Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar endowed a hospital and dispensary in the Native Infirmary. In 1836, Madras University established M.B. & G.M. and L.M & S medical courses in the Native Infirmary. In 1903, a hospital assistant course was introduced with the help of the East India Company. In 1911, the first graduating class was awarded their Licensed Medical Practitioner (LMP) diplomas.</p>
